			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>My name is Delaney, but my friends call me Laney. I am a junior Cardiovascular technology major at the University of South Carolina. I am from a small town in Maryland, and spend my summers working at preschool summercamps with my mom. I have one brother. His name is Ethan and he is 3.5 years older than me. My family has a dog names Ollie. </p>

			<p id="ptwo" class="hidden">At the University of South Carolina, I am a member of the cheerleading team. I cheer for the football team in the fall, the women's basketball team in the winter and then we compete in Daytona Beach in the spring. I live with 3 other cheerleaders who are my best friends. I love to read, workout, cook and hangout with my friends. </p>

			<h2>My Future Career Plans</h2>
			<p>
			After this semester, I am hoping to attend MUSC invasive cardiovascular technology school. This is an 18 month program that would allow me to work as a cardiovascular technologoist. I would be working in a cathederization lab at the hospital. This field is growing rapidly. </p> 
			<p> After I have worked for a few years as a CVT, I may choose to go back to school. If I go back to school, it will be to physicians assistant school. I would hope to attend MUSC in Charleston and graduate as a PA in two years. As a PA, I could choose to work in many different specialties and in many different locations. I eventually see myself working in an out-patient center. </p>
